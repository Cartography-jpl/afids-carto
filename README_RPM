To make a RPM for installing as a redhat package, we can do the following:

1. Do a configure using the configure found in this file. Note that you
   can either use "--with-afids-a" or leave it out, the afids a patch
   is included in the distribution tar file in the first case, but not
   the second.
2. make distcheck. Note that this will *fail* because ossim doesn't have
   an uninstall command. But you can make sure everthing builds first.
   You can also just do make dist to skip the testing
3. cp carto-1.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
4. rpmbuild -ba <srcdir>/carto.spec

We then have the RPMs ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/carto-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm and
~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/carto-1.0-1.src.rpm which can be copied to a repository.
